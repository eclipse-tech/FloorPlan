# FloorPlan

The idea is to capture the room details and dimensions of any project by extracting text from the floor plan of a project.

Problem:
1. For quotation generator contractors will have to fill all the room details manually and this creates friction for generating the estimator.

2. Designer needs dimensions of the wall in the project since our designer is not visiting the project site physically. Capturing those we would have to create dependency on the contractor to capture those.

3. We need to find a reliable way with which we can estimate the carpet area of the house for the designer to verify if the entered value of the carpet area is correct while purchasing DAAS.

Benefit:
1. This can help us in creating a custom quotation for the project which will reduce a lot of hassle of entering individual room details for the contractor. Also, it can assist contractors to decide dimensions of individual items in the quotation which can lead to a much more accurate quotation amount.

2. Dimensions of the rooms are readily available to the designer which will help the designer to design more precisely.

3. Carpet area calculation can be done for the designer to verify the details entered by the contractor. If we take this one step further then we can autofill the carpet area and reduce friction of contractors filling this detail.

We want to validate the data captured from the floor plans and input these into our product for quotation generation and DAAS projectâ€™s initial inputs.
